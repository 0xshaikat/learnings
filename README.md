# 🚀 Learnings

## 📖 Overview
I'm currently trying to learn (hopefully successfully):
- 📖  Mathematics for Machine Learning
- 🌐 System Design
- 💸 Smart Contract Programming

This repo will may contain a combination of LaTeX, Markdown, as well as code to reflect what I've learnt and is more so a personal accountability framework for myself, but I hope it's useful for others as well.

There is a subdirectory for each goal.
